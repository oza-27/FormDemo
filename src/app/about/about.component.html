<p class="paraAbout"> 
    Angular (also referred to as "Angular 2+")[4] is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript">TypeScript-based</a>, free and open-source web application framework led
    by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the
    same team that built AngularJS. Angular is a single-page application framework which is used for creating fast web
    Applications. It uses concepts of single-page application in which UI is delivered in the beginning of application
    request and later only data is requested which makes single-page application applications fast.
